#	Electric chuchu attacks player
#		Same stats as ice chuchu but lightning instead of ice.
#		Combat function with 15 monster hp and 2 electric atk

#To get down from sky island, player must kill a zonai guardian and find a sleeping aurocouda and hop on and fly down. Upon landing in Hyrule Field, you must find and kill The Hinox who guards the Master Sword
#
#After killing him using the combat function, (Hinox has 20 hp and 3 atk) then have player loot master sword, increasing his melee atk power by 10, or increase it by 20 against gloom creatures. Player then goes to Lookout Landing and talks to people. Give player option of who to talk to. Also have player find a royal guards bow. Then give player option to go to either Tabantha, Eldin, Lanaryu, tabantha sky, gerudo. After completing all of those regions, they can then go to Hyrule castle
# So throughout the game player loots items like monster horns that increase player atk against that type of monster. So if player consumes boko horn, player atk against boko is increase. Does not stack.
#The way inventory works is that we will have a dictionary and keys for mob horns, weapons, and food. Anytime player loots monster horn, add it into the key monster horns as a value. Etc with the others.
#So ask player if they wanna buy or sell from merchants (make a variable called Rupees for currency.)The player starts with 20 rupees.
#Make a function called market with one argument called player currency.
#	While Loop it!
    #	Give player option to either sell or buy or leave
    #	If player chooses to sell
    #		Show player inv
    #		Ask player to select one item
    #		Then sell item and give player 20 rupees and add them to player currency
    #	Elif player chooses to buy
    #		Show player merchant wares
    #		If merchant is weapons merchant
    #			Display weapons
    #		Elif merchant is food merchant
    #			Display food
    #		Give player option to choose an item or leave
    #		If player chooses to leave
    #			Close merchant
    #		Elif player chooses to select item
    #			Take 20 rupees from player and put item in player inventory
    #		Ask player if they would like to stay and spend more money or leave
    #		If they would like to shop more
    #			Loop it
    #		Elif they wanna leave
    #			Close shop
    #	Elif player chooses to leave
    #		Close shop
#Call function every time they go to merchant
#Now have them leave lookout landing
#Ask if they want to go to tabantha, eldin, tabantha sky, gerudo, lanaryu, or eldin caves
#If tabantha
#	tabantha()
#If gerudo
#	gerudo()
#If eldin
#	eldin()
#If lanaryu
#	lanaryu()
#If eldin caves
#	eldin_caves()
#If tabantha sky
#	Tabantha_sky()
#Once they beat all regions
#They go to hyrule castle and fight boss
#Boss is the demon king
#Secret room in hyrule castle before boss
#Demon King has 50 hp and 10 atk
#If he dies, end game
#If player dies, restart fight
