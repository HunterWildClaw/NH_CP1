print("So here's the story.\nThe crew earned a whole bunch of money on the last outing, but the captain didn't have time to divvy it all up before release everyone to port. He gave each member of the crew 500 dollars for the evening and then sat down with his first mate to properly divide the shares. ")
print("You're number you gave is the total ammount of money. Now we split it up. *cracks knuckles and pops neck* Watch me cook")
